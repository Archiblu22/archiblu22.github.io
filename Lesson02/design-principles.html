            <h3>Homie</h3>
            <a href="https://www.homie.com/">homie.com</a>
            <div>
            <img src="images/HomieMobileView.JPG" alt="Homie homepage">
            </div>
            <p>Fitt's law talks about the ease of accessing what the viewer needs quickly by the use of buttons. Homie does well with that in both a desktop and mobile view. They make their buttons stand out with color and are larger than any other link available. When you change the size of the screen, it will continue to stay large and accessible.</p>
            <p>As you continue with the process, the button begins to fill more of the screen directing you exactly where you need to go. To buy a home on Homie or simply search for one is easy because of the way these buttons guide you.</p>

            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>
            <div>
                <img src="images/AppleMobileView.JPG" alt="Apple homepage">
            </div>
            <p>I love the way Apple uses the principle of Contrast on their site. They maintain a very black to white design which makes it so you can quickly see what they are advertising and read their content easily. Even their images will follow that example of a very dark, vibrant color of their product against a white background.</p>
            <p>With this contrast it also makes it easy for the consumer to spot what they want as they won't be blinded by so many different colors everywhere. It makes the user experience quick and clean.</p>

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <article>
            <h3>Nike</h3>
            <a href="https://www.nike.com/">nike.com</a>
            <div>
                <img src="images/NikeMobileView.JPG" alt="Nike homepage">
            </div>
            <p>When reviewing Nike's site, all I see is a white background on the site and even on most of the pictures of their products and models. This makes the entire site look extra clean and help your eyes catch on to the images that matter most: their products!</p>
            <p>The amount of white space that is there helps things to stay very organized and easy to read/navigate through. I thought it was interesting in the article we read about this where it states "white space promotes elegance and sophistication, improves legibility, and drives focus." A lot of those characteristics fits Nike's brand.</p>
